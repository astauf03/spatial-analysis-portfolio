# Chicago Burglary & Pothole Analysis (2017–2018)

This project investigates whether 311 alley pothole complaints are predictive of burglary patterns in Chicago using spatial statistics and predictive modeling.

### Methods
- 500m x 500m fishnet grid  
- Spatial join & nearest-neighbor features  
- Local Moran’s I and LISA cluster maps  
- Poisson & Negative Binomial regression  
- KDE baseline comparison  
- Leave-One-Grid-Out spatial cross-validation  
- Temporal validation (2018 predictions)

### Key Findings
- Potholes show **weak independent predictive power** after controlling for socioeconomic variables.
- KDE baseline slightly outperformed regression models in raw accuracy.
- Spatial generalization moderate; temporal generalization weaker.
