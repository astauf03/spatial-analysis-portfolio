# Alex Stauffer's Geospatial Analytics Portfolio 

This portfolio showcases my work using a combination of ArcGIS Pro, R, and Python for geoprocessing, spatial analysis, and visualization.  
Each project demonstrates practical applications of Esri tools and spatial reasoning to real-world urban data, including Philadelphia-based datasets.

## Projects

### 1. Public Policy Analytics Assignment 4: Predictive Policing – Chicago 2017 - 2018 
**Goal:** I analyze the 311 "Alley Pothole Complaints" across the city of Chicago in correlation with forced-entry burglaries and other structural features. 
**Tools & Methods:**
- Spatial join and fishnet aggregations  
- Local Moran’s I (LISA) for spatial clustering, Poisson and Negative Binomial regressions, Leave-One-Group-Out cross-validation  
- Symbology and classification for identifying high-high and low-low clusters  
**Outcome:** Potholes weakly predict burglary risk, but demographics and neighborhood conditions explain most patterns

### 2. Liquor License Clustering – Philadelphia
**Goal:** Identify concentrations of active PLCB-licensed businesses (restaurants, bars, clubs) to understand nightlife and economic activity patterns.  
**Tools & Methods:**
- Spatial Join and Clip to align license data with neighborhood boundaries  
- Hot Spot Analysis (Getis-Ord Gi*) and Local Moran’s I for spatial clustering  
- Symbology and classification for identifying high-high and low-low clusters  
**Outcome:** Mapped statistically significant clusters of bar and restaurant licenses, highlighting the corridor’s role as a nightlife destination.

## About
I’m a spatial data analyst with experience in **urban spatial analysis, GIS workflows, and visualization** using Esri tools and data analytical lnaguages like R and Python.  
My work focuses on connecting spatial data to insights about neighborhood structure, land use, and community change. I am interested in 
the nighttime culture and economies, and empowering cities with tools for 24-hour operation.
