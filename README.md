#Alex Stauffer's GIS portfolio 

This portfolio showcases my work using **ArcGIS Pro** for geoprocessing, spatial analysis, and visualization.  
Each project demonstrates practical applications of Esri tools and spatial reasoning to real-world urban data, including Philadelphia-based datasets.

## Projects

### 1. Liquor License Clustering – Philadelphia
**Goal:** Identify concentrations of active PLCB-licensed businesses (restaurants, bars, clubs) to understand nightlife and economic activity patterns.  
**Tools & Methods:**
- Spatial Join and Clip to align license data with neighborhood boundaries  
- Hot Spot Analysis (Getis-Ord Gi*) and Local Moran’s I for spatial clustering  
- Symbology and classification for identifying high-high and low-low clusters  
**Outcome:** Mapped statistically significant clusters of bar and restaurant licenses, highlighting the corridor’s role as a nightlife destination.

### 2. East Passyunk Neighborhood Analysis
**Goal:** Examine commercial and food-service land use distribution within the East Passyunk neighborhood.  
**Tools & Methods:**
- Buffer and Spatial Join to analyze businesses within walkable distances  
- Kernel Density Estimation for hotspot visualization  
- Field calculations and attribute joins in ArcGIS Pro  
**Outcome:** Identified spatial concentrations of food-service establishments and their relationship to the corridor’s urban form.

## About
I’m a spatial data analyst with experience in **urban spatial analysis, GIS workflows, and visualization** using Esri tools and data analytical langauges like R and Python.  
My work focuses on connecting spatial data to insights about neighborhood structure, land use, and community change. I am interested in 
the nighttime culture and economies, and empowering cities with tools for 24-hour operation.
