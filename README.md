# Alex Stauffer's Geospatial Analytics Portfolio 

This portfolio showcases my work using a combination of ArcGIS Pro, R, and Python for geoprocessing, spatial analysis, and visualization.  
Each project demonstrates practical applications of Esri tools and spatial reasoning to real-world urban data, including Philadelphia-based datasets.

## Projects

### 1. Public Policy Analytics Assignment 4: Predictive Policing – Chicago 2017 - 2018 
**Goal:** I analyze the 311 "Alley Pothole Complaints" across the city of Chicago in correlation with forced-entry burglaries and other structural features. 
**Tools & Methods:**
- Spatial join and fishnet aggregations  
- Local Moran’s I (LISA) for spatial clustering, Poisson and Negative Binomial regressions, Leave-One-Group-Out cross-validation  
- Symbology and classification for identifying high-high and low-low clusters  
**Outcome:** Potholes weakly predict burglary risk, but demographics and neighborhood conditions explain most patterns

### 2. Liquor License Clustering – Philadelphia [Ongoing]
**Goal:** Summarize active business licenses and PLCB liquor licenses within the East Passyunk study area to describe corridor-scale dining and nightlife activity.  

**What I built:** A dashboard-style HTML report with (1) a licensing road map and (2) a breakdown of license types by category.

**Tools:** R (sf, dplyr, ggplot2), OpenDataPhilly business licenses, PLCB geocoded license data, ArcGIS Online 


**Key takeaways:** Food service activity is a major share of active business licenses; PLCB licenses cluster along East Passyunk Ave; sidewalk café licenses reinforce the corridor’s pedestrian-oriented identity.

## About
I’m a spatial data analyst with experience in **urban spatial analysis, GIS workflows, and visualization** using Esri tools and data analytical lnaguages like R and Python.  
My work focuses on connecting spatial data to insights about neighborhood structure, land use, and community change. I am interested in 
the nighttime culture and economies, and empowering cities with tools for 24-hour operation.
